        <h2>Introduction to Crypto</h2>

        <div class="intro-text">

          <p>Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies secured by cryptography and don't exist in physical forms like the
            US
            dollar. Popular cryptocurrencies like
            Bitcoin (BTC),Ethereum (ETH), andPolkadot (DOT) are supported by an underlying technology called blockchain,
            which acts as a decentralized digital ledger.</p>

          <p>Every cryptocurrency transaction is recorded on the blockchain and becomes unchangeable once confirmed and
            validated. Unlike traditional currencies that rely on banks for centralized control, cryptocurrency
            transactions occur on a public blockchain accessible to anyone.</p>

          <p>Furthermore, depending on the consensus mechanism, anyone can validate transactions and add them to the
            blockchain, making cryptocurrencies decentralized.
          </p>

          <div class="more-text" id="more-text">

            <p>Many believe blockchain technology will revolutionize the global financial system, with increasing
              institutional investments from leading companies like Samsung, BlackRock, Morgan Stanley, and Alphabet.
            </p>

            <p>
              Trading cryptocurrencies allows one to explore the world of decentralized finance and engage with emerging
              technology.
            </p>

            <p>You can now purchase popular cryptocurrencies like
              Tether (USDT)
              ,
              Polygon (POL)
              ,
              Dogecoin (DOGE)
              , and more using various payment methods, including Apple Pay, Visa, Mastercard, MoonPay, and bank
              transfers. You can also swap existing digital assets through
              OKX Convert
              without fees or price slippage or buy crypto directly from other sellers via the
              OKX P2P Trading
              market.</p>

      <h2>Currently, mainstream industries in this world hold 5 viewpoints towards Bitcoin and blockchain technology,
        with
        a consensus slowly being formed. These are:</h2>

      <div class="mainstream-text">

        <p>1. Bitcoin is a virtual good and is similar in many ways to more traditional investments.</p>

        <p>2. Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer payment method and has the potential of challenging Visa’s market dominance.</p>

        <p>3. The Bitcoin blockchain, as an underlying blockchain, can provide consensus solutions to other public
          blockchains, with Bitcoin itself as the fees for this service. Because of this, the Bitcoin blockchain may
          become the infrastructure on which all other blockchain applications are built in the future.</p>

        <p>4. Bitcoin is a virtual currency on the internet. It has some attributes of traditional currencies and some
          attributes of traditional payments systems in certain internet communities.</p>

        <p>5. Bitcoin is a reserve asset like gold, and because of its standardization, divisibility, and the ability of
          conducting online transfers, it has great advantages in many aspects such as payment efficiency, preservation
          cost, and more. Because of this, it has the potential of becoming a form of "digital gold", and is therefore
          an asset with the possibility of replacing gold in the internet of value era.</p>

        <div class="mainstream-more" id="mainStreamMore">
          <p>Most countries do not recognize Bitcoin as currency, instead defining it as virtual good. Nevertheless,
            many jurisdictions have established regulations or have actively started to support its growth. The overall
            attitude of regulatory bodies is now changing from a neutral view to a positive one. The United States
            itself has included Bitcoin into the traditional financial regulatory system, with Bitcoin companies being
            required to apply for MTLs (Money Transmitting Licenses). The state of New York has introduced BitLicense
            for the exclusive regulation of Bitcoin. Many European countries have also been adopting positive attitudes
            towards Bitcoin. Some countries have established regulatory a framework for Bitcoin, with some of these
            insisting that Bitcoin-involved economic activities should be subject to traditional taxes. The FSA of Japan
            has officially recognized Bitcoin and digital currency as a legal currency, and has ruled that all digital
            currency exchanges must register with them. The Russian government issued a ban on Bitcoin in the past, but
            has revoked it after many other jurisdictions published their regulations. The governor of the Indian
            central bank Raghuram Rajan said that before we have a consensus on the potential of Bitcoin, we should
            study it in-depth instead of act too forcibly.</p>
